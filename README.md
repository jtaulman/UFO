# UFO

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to create a website that puts information on UFO and UFO sightings in one place. This information was supposed to be represented in a working filtered table, based on five seperate filters. 

## Results

When looking at the webpage below the description gives an overview about UFO's living in the universe. The table at the bottom orginailly contains all the information, but there are five different filters. The filters do not have a button it just needs to be typed into the filtered area. Once the information is in the filtered area the table changes to adapt to the information requested.

## Summary

After searching through the webpage, there are a couple missing pieces. The first step is updating the data so the site has the most up to date data. The final step is to put in a little key that describes some of the information to make the filters easier for someone that has never seen the data. As stated before having more data would be very helpful for people searching for information about UFO's.
